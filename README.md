## Sysventory

Sysventory is a hardware and software inventory solution for systems that are not connected to a network. The benefit of Sysventory is that it enables the inventory of systems on an air-gaped network. It is a Python script that can be compiled using py2exe with the objective of being run without Python being installed on the operating system. It is also designed to be a cross platform solution that will gather Windows, MAC OSX and Linux system information. The script ideally should be copied to a USB key. The inventory data is saved both to a log file and an SQLite database. Therefore, if the script is run on multiple machines from the same USB key all the data will be stored in the same database and log files. The db file can then either be exported to an enterprise inventory software solution or accessed with a custom web application.
